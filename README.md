# IRCTC Train Information Tool

This Python script provides a basic interface to access Indian Railways information through the Indian Rail API. It allows you to view train schedules. **Note:** API access may require a key.

## Features

- **View Train Schedule:** Enter a train number to see station names, arrival times, and departure times.

## Running the Code

1. Save the code as `irctc.py`.
2. Install the `requests` library using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install requests


## How would you like to proceed?
1. Enter 1 to check live train status (Currently unavailable)
2. Enter 2 to check PNR (Currently unavailable)
3. Enter 3 to check train schedule


**Make sure to replace `"apikey/YOUR_API_KEY"` with the actual placeholder or description in the code where the user needs to insert their API key. This `README.md` file will help others understand how to use and potentially contribute to your project.**
